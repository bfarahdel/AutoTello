# AutoTello

An autonomous Tello drone that can be communicated with. The drone can be operated with a voice assistant (see short the video clip below for the backflip command). This involves application of function calling in LLMs as well as computer vision. The drone can currently be instructed to move as well as provide a description of what is viewed through the camera.
